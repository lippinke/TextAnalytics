Avery took out a land claim at the mouth of Marys River Oregon Marys River where it flows into the Willamette River and in June 1846 took up residence there in a log cabin hastily constructed to hold what seemed a potentially lucrative claim Averys primitive 1846 dwelling was the first home within the boundaries of todays Corvallis and his land claim included the southern section of the contemporary city Avery was quickly joined by other settlers along the banks of the Willamette River including a 640-acre claim directly to his north taken in September 1846 by William F Dixon The discovery of gold in California in 1848 temporarily stalled development of a township with Avery leaving his Oregon claim to try his hand at mining in the fall of that year His stay would prove to be brief and in January 1849 Avery returned to Oregon with a small stock of provisions with a view to opening a store During the year 1849 Avery opened his store at the site platted the land and surveyed a town site on his land claim naming the community Marysville It is possible that the city was named after early settler Mary Lloyd but now the name is thought to be derived from French fur trappers naming of Marys Peak after the Mary mother of Jesus Virgin Mary  In the summer of 1851 Joseph Avery and William Dixon each granted back-to-back 40 acre land parcels from their land holdings for the establishment of a county seat Averys holding lay to the south and Dixons to the north with the Benton County Courthouse Oregon Benton Country Courthouse marking the approximate line of demarcation between these two land parcels Name change In December 1853 the 5th Oregon Territorial Legislature met in Salem Oregon Salem where a petition was presented seeking to change the name of that city to either Thurston or Valena At the same time another petition was presented seeking to change the name of Salem to Corvallis from the Latin meaning heart of the valley while a third resolution was presented to the upper house seeking the change the name of Marysville to Corvallis  A heated debate followed with the name ultimately awarded to Marysville in an act passed on December 20 1853 By way of rationale it was successfully argued that the name Marysville duplicated the moniker of Marysville California a town in California located on the same stagecoach route and that a name change was thus necessary to avoid confusion Incorporation A faction within the deeply divided legislature sought to make Corvallis the capital of the Oregon Territory and in December 1855 the 6th Territorial Legislature initially convened there before returning to Salem later that month — the town which would eventually be selected as the permanent seat of state government Corvallis was incorporated as a city on January 29 1857 19th Century growth Nineteenth-century Corvallis saw a three-year boom beginning in 1889 which began with the establishment of a privately owned electrical plant by LL Hurd A flurry of publicity and public and private investment followed including construction of a grand county courthouse planning and first construction of a new street railway construction of a new flour mill along the river between Monroe and Jackson Avenues and construction of the Julian Hotel Hotel Corvallis today known as the Julian Hotel In addition a carriage factory was launched in the city and the towns streets were improved while the size of the city was twice enlarged through annexation Bonds were issued for a city-owned water works a sewer system and for public ownership of the electric plant A publicity campaign was launched to attempt to expand the tax base through new construction for new arrivals This effort proved mostly unsuccessful however and in 1892 normalcy returned with the city saddled with about $150000 in bonded debt Geography Corvallis is at an elevation of above sea level Situated midway in the Willamette Valley Corvallis is about east of Newport Oregon Newport
